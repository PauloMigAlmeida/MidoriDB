# MidoriDB
In-memory database written in C from scratch

## Wishlist
To make sure I won't lose focus on what I want this database to be able to do, I decided to write a list of features
that I want to implement in the short to medium term.

- [ ] Flat Transation support
- [ ] In-memory database
- [ ] Write Ahead Log
